=====================

Notes for running a Cal III course based on Hass's Calculus text (Chapters 10-14)

## Can you be more specific?

Sure - I've had, for many semesters, a detailed lecture note packet which I used in my lectures and 
passed out to my students. But, I decided most of it was unnecessary as the average student wouldn't
appreciate the details, and the competent lecturer should be able to expound upon the details on
his or her own.

It's based on Hass's "University Calculus" text, chapters 10-14.

## Can I use this or contribute?

Please! Auburn University is changing textbooks, so I'll likely be redoing this for a new text next
semester, but if you're using Hass please feel free to use this yourself or adapt it however you
wish. I'd appreciate any feedback, pull requests, etc etc.
