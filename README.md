Notes to accompany Chapters 12 to 16 of Stewart's Calculus - Early Transcendentals, 7th edition

Abstract
--------

These notes are written to support the major topics covered in Auburn University's Calculus III course based on Stewart's book.

In addition, several example problems based on these notes have also been written.

This project is based off of my earlier [HassNotes-10to14](http://github.com/StevenClontz/HassNotes-10to14) project based on Hass's University Calculus.
