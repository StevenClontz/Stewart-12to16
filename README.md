Notes to accompany Chapters 12 to 16 of Stewart's Calculus - Early Transcendentals, 7th edition

This repo is still a work-in-progress.

Abstract
--------

These notes are written to support the major topics covered in Auburn University's Calculus III course based on Stewart's book.

In addition, several example problems based on these notes have also been written.

This project is based off of [Steven Clontz](http://www.stevenclontz.com)'s earlier [HassNotes-10to14](http://github.com/StevenClontz/HassNotes-10to14) project based on Hass's University Calculus.

Purpose
-------

The purpose of these notes is not to replace any calculus or analysis textbook, but rather to be used as a guide/outline for students and instructors covering the topics in a Calculus III course.

As such, when deemed necessary, mathematical rigor is abandoned for the sake of simplicity or brevity. Instructors are expected to elaborate during lecture whenever rigor is desired, but students should be able to use these notes as a "good-enough" resource for working on computational problems.
